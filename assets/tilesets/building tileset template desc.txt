I need to prepare a proper building tileset template. I'm going to completely change how I do buildings.
Each building type needs a strictly defined tileset layout that accounts for all possibilities that a building would need. If I change a tileset, i'll have to remap the resource.

So what tiles do I need.
Firstly, i'm going to use the full 32 pixels rather than use the 4 pixel space for overhangs and other details. This is to give the characters more space, and to hopefully make parts of the tileset mutable.

Every building tileset will follow a particular style. I'm going to make one for the development of the map with the idea that I can make each of the towns and areas unique with unique tilesets later. The one I've created already suits a 1750s style house with a layed brick ground floor and a wooden upper floor, also having a wooden lower floor. I'm not sure if this will be used on any of the town's buildings in the future but it makes for a good template for the setting.

There are shape tiles, and then there is the style of tile. Every style will need every shape, and the tilesheet should be organised by style.

I'm also going to harden the corners of buildings

The basic building tilesheet has 2 main styles: brick stone, and a sort of tudoresque wood and clay. these are styles of wall. Each style of wall needs tiles with and without windows, as well as a front / back door.
